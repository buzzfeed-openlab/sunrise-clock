# sunrise-clock
a rotating 24-hr dial that changes the color of a lamp according to the likely color of the sky

The sunrise clock is a demo version of the notwatch, a watch that instead of showing the time only shows the likely color of the sky based on a sunrise/sunset algorithm.

In this demo, one dial made from a Particle Internet Button relays information to a second set of buttons enclosed in a lampshade.
